# üêæ Animal Detection and Alert System using Raspberry Pi 4

This project provides a smart and automated solution for detecting wildlife in remote areas using Raspberry Pi 4, sensors, and a machine learning model. It aims to prevent human-wildlife conflict by identifying animals, storing their images in the cloud, and sending SMS alerts to local authorities or residents in real time.

##  Project Overview

Wildlife intrusion into human habitats is increasing due to urbanization and habitat loss. Our system detects, identifies, and notifies the presence of wild animals to reduce potential harm to both humans and animals.

-  **Captures animal images using a USB webcam**
-  **Identifies animals using a CNN model (VGG19-based)**
-  **Uploads images to Google Drive**
-  **Sends SMS alerts via SMSChef API**

## üîÑSystem Workflow

1. **Detection Phase**:  
   Ultrasonic sensor detects movement.

2. **Image Capture**:  
   USB camera captures an image when movement is detected.

3. **Processing Phase**:  
   Image is resized and normalized.

4. **Animal Detection**:  
   CNN model classifies the image into one of 32 animal classes.

5. **Alert System**:  
   SMS alert is sent with date and time of detection.

6. **Cloud Upload**:  
   Captured image is uploaded to a designated Google Drive folder.
